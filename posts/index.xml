      <description>After two days, I&#39;m finally able to talk to the world using the Hugo framework!
There are a few things I needed to read to get it up and running, including the hugo documentation. Setting up the domain was the hardest part. Because Ã¸ is non-ascii, I needed to convert my website to punycode and update the CNAME.
I also used a template made by HTML5 UP to get this up and running, which was also easy to customize.</description>
