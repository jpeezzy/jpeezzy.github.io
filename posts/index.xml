      <description>Recently I have experienced hand pain while typing. This pain can be attributed to excessively typing and practicing guitar. The standard procedures to alleviate the pain are:
 hand stretches finger exercises rest.  But I would rather be productive. Instead of resting my hands, I&#39;ve been learning colemak, an alternate keyboard layout designed to minimize hand strain. One nice aspect about colemak is that it maps the caps lock key to backspace, minimizing key travel (more on this later).</description>

      <description>After two days, I&#39;m finally able to talk to the world using the Hugo framework!
There are a few things I needed to read to get it up and running, including the hugo documentation. Setting up the domain was the hardest part. Because Ã¸ is non-ascii, I needed to convert my website to punycode and update the CNAME.
I also used a template made by HTML5 UP to get this up and running, which was also easy to customize.</description>
